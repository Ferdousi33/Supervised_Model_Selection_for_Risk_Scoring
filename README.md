# Supervised_Model_Selection_for_Risk_Scoring

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict risk-scores from clinical features. It compares multiple models, points out contributing features, calculates risk score and provides visualization for performance and interpretability of the model.

## Methods

**Models used :** Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest
**Evaluation metrics :** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Confusion Matrix
**Feature Importance :** Top features identified using Random Forest
**Risk Score :** Computed for each patient using Random Forest

## Outputs and plots

**Confusion Matrix :** Shows the number of patients correctly or incorrectly classified by the model
**Feature Importance :** Underscores the top features contributing most to heart disease prediction
**Risk Score Table :** Summarizes predicted risk scores that is categorized into low, medium and high risk levels

Visual outputs are in the images folder and dataset used for the project is in dataset folder.
